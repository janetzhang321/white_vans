Our runtime classification of mergesort is: n*log(n). We think the log(n) comes from splitting the array, and the linear runtime comes from the merging of the arrays.

If n is the length of the array, then the depth of the binary decision tree would be log(n) (As Aparna mentioned on her post to Piazza). Therefore, there is a logarithmic correlation between the length of the array and the number of steps it takes the split the array into arrays of length=1.

During the merging of the arrays, every element is “touched” once when deciding the order of the elements in the merged list, and it is through this action that the linear aspect of the big O is produced. Although it isn’t exactly following a runtime of O(n), we follow the rule where classifications similar to this run-time are “reduced” down to a general form of O(n).
